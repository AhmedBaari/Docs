## Via Bot In A Nutshell

Via is a discord bot that gives roles to actively texting members, members in voice channels and members with a custom status that supports the server. 

For example, when a member sends a message in your server, they get the active role, say, `@Active`. They have it as long as they continue texting in your server. The bot removes the role after a certain amount of time after their last message. 

Here's another example. You have a server called **Wumpus World**. You want to give the **@Supporters** role to members who have a custom status of `.gg/wumpus`. Via Bot's loyal roles feature can do this for you!

### So you got a DM

- When you are in a community which has the active roles or loyal roles feature enabled, you will get a DM if you are getting the role for the first time from the bot.
  - The `ID:000` in the bottom of the DM message is your Via ID. You can use it when contacting us in our support server.


### Hey, thanks by the way :D
